Santa came early for Prince Nicolae of Romania and his youngest daughter, Maria-Alexandra, who was born at the beginning of November this year. Through the Rotenberg-Uzunov gallery, the Princess received as a gift two unique paintings for her room, one of them representing the little girl herself, surrounded by some of the most famous animated characters. Her father received a portrait of her great-great-grandmother, Queen Maria of Romania.

The idea of offering this royal gift came to the businessman Eduard Uzunov two weeks ago, during the charity event "Art gives hope", organized for sick children hospitalized at the Fundeni Clinical Institute.

"When we organized "Arta gives hope", Nicolae came, like every time at the events of the Rotenberg-Uzunov gallery, and he really liked some of the works that were going to be donated to the Fundeni Clinical Institute. One, which was practically the central work of the collection, representing a panda bear in the jungle, made by plastic artist Arina Bican, as well as two works by plastic artist Martina Grigorita, with animated characters. Then I thought of this Christmas present for Maria-Alexandra and the idea enjoyed the unconditional support of the two artists. In order to make one of the works, I had to tell Nicolae about our intention, so that we could get a photo of the little one, which could be reproduced, but we agreed together that the gift should be a total surprise for the Prince's wife, Alina - Maria", declared Eduard Uzunov.

Thus, the wife of Nicolae of Romania stopped by the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery, at her husband's insistence, without knowing what was waiting for her, so the gift offered in the presence of the two artists and some art friends had the desired effect.

"The fact that the artists made these works from the heart can be felt from what the work conveys or, as they say, from the way God closes that work. I hope that the love from the work will be transmitted to Maria-Alexandra", said Eduard Uzunov.

For her part, the Prince's wife declared that it is "a supersurprise that they will remember all their lives" and that she is honored to receive such a gift, adding that the frame of the painting in which her little girl appears is exactly the color of the furniture in the little one's room: pink.

Even if the limited event was set up with his complicity and Prince Nicolae had a surprise: he received as a gift a work signed by Martina Grigoriță, a portrait of his great-great-grandmother, Queen Maria of Romania.

"I already know where I'm going to put this work with Queen Mary! It will be placed next to another work, with my grandfather, King Michael I of Romania. They must stay together", said Nicolae, impressed by the beauty of the painting.

Arina Bican and Martina Grigorita are among the most valuable visual artists of the moment, already having countless personal and group exhibitions, projects and certificates that recommend them. Beyond all this, for any viewer of their works, the most impressive thing is the talent of the artists in the interweaving of colors and the unmistakable style of each of them.
