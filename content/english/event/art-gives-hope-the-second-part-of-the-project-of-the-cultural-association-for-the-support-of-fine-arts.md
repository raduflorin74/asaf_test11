The statement from the preview of the project "*Art gives hope*" - part two, by Mrs. President **Adina Rențea**:

"If I still exist in the world of art, after 30 years of activity, it is because I have lived and felt, during these years, unique moments and feelings. I saw how art ennobles souls, increases humanity, love for fellow human beings and the desire to do good!

I wrote some time ago that, within the next two months, we will complete the second part of the Arta gives Hope project! After, in December, the Association for the Support of Fine Arts donated 40 works to beautify the 6th floor of the Fundeni Clinical Institute, where the children with hemato-oncological diseases are located, now we are preparing to complete the project, to open the exhibition and, once again, to bring joy and hope to children's souls!

They joined our approach from the second part, 18 important artists of the moment, whose concerns are also directed towards design, architecture, advertising graphics or book illustration. The 30 works, whose theme intertwines so beautifully with the world related to fairy tales and childhood stories, can be admired in the exhibition that will open on Wednesday, March 10, at 5 p.m., at the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery. Just for one day. Then they will leave for their final destination.

It gives me a great honor to present the names of the artists from the second part of the Arta gives Hope project: Cela Neamţu, Dalina Bădescu, Irina Neacșu, Maria Jarda, Radu Goia, Rareş Kerekes, Adelina Boroş, Andreea Ungureanu, Bogdan Cazacincu, Diana Cristina Enache, Oana Pavelescu, Sebastian Oprica, Simona Pascale, Mugurel Bărbulescu, Iulia Ignat, Laura Măhăleanu, Lavinia Falcan, Doina Albu.

Project supported by the same man of art and goodness - **Eduard Uzunov**!

To all, my chosen thanks!"
