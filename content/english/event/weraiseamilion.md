Inspire the miracle of Christmas and breathe love\
It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words. If that were true, then a greeting card would be like a story. If the greeting card were sent at Christmas, then her story would be about generosity, kindness, magic, miracles. Surely the sender would feel the deep miracle of joy as well as the recipient.

Starting from this idea, the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery, the Cultural Association for the Support of Fine Arts (ASAF), in collaboration with the Wings to Life Association, continues the series of humanitarian projects - started last year with the project "Art gives Hope" - with a new approach , this time, to children who, in order to have a chance at life, need ventilation at home.

The [\#weraiseonenmilion](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/weraiseonenmilion?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZU8qJ4DVyr57MgIfRl_eDjyRZ4iFBG62aXHu2meZxLQSLh9Ncu9tyDRci5hyKZczBto5zrEcmhASIEv9qHMpKZOPuz0Cn3VNj-skRJfnWn2RYLjbcMxSLdv4JNDfXKZbvqenGUqTjSIyKJpgRhJYMkh_MHcythXMoFxVYONAa8PGA&__tn__=q) campaign, aims immediately to raise the necessary amounts for the purchase of ventilation devices, for the payment of the rents of the already existing ones, and of their specific consumables, for the year 2022.\
From 2018 until now, the Wings to Life Association has provided financial support in the amount of 449,098.17 lei, for Valentina, Ioana, Ana-Maria, Iulia, Sofia, Ilinca-Alexandra, Ionela and Alexandru, registered in the pediatric department respiratory of the Emergency Clinical Hospital MS Curia, and diagnosed with serious ailments.\
The dependence of these children on the breathing apparatus would condemn them to a permanent hospitalization, and we through the project [\#weraiseonemillion](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/weraiseonemillion?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZU8qJ4DVyr57MgIfRl_eDjyRZ4iFBG62aXHu2meZxLQSLh9Ncu9tyDRci5hyKZczBto5zrEcmhASIEv9qHMpKZOPuz0Cn3VNj-skRJfnWn2RYLjbcMxSLdv4JNDfXKZbvqenGUqTjSIyKJpgRhJYMkh_MHcythXMoFxVYONAa8PGA&__tn__=q), we wish to be able to continue to offer them a real chance at life, at home in the family environment.

So, on December 8, for the 8 children, we launch the campaign [\#weraiseonemilion](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/weraiseonemilion?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZU8qJ4DVyr57MgIfRl_eDjyRZ4iFBG62aXHu2meZxLQSLh9Ncu9tyDRci5hyKZczBto5zrEcmhASIEv9qHMpKZOPuz0Cn3VNj-skRJfnWn2RYLjbcMxSLdv4JNDfXKZbvqenGUqTjSIyKJpgRhJYMkh_MHcythXMoFxVYONAa8PGA&__tn__=q), starting with 17:00, at the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery, located in Constantin Esarcu Street no. 1, in a fairytale setting, whose scenography bears the signature of Adrian Damian, through the exhibition with the sale of 30,000 of the most beautiful Christmas cards.

The congratulations are made by one of the best photographers and author of art albums in Romania, Gheorghe Voicu, some of them with gold leaf, printed 30 years ago, and offered to our cause, by the wife of the late illustrator.

The cards can be purchased at the headquarters of the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery, from Constantin Esarcu Street, no. 1-3, between December 8 and December 23, 2021, as well as online on the website [www.rotenberguzunov.ro.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rotenberguzunov.ro%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0RQ_K_sTl8OmUTF16zowMx6GBNOeJN477U7SS22Wy9t4i0SmE5s9ZY0sk_aem_-yZ09YNQ7-6IouivXZRvWQ&h=AT2C7hfAZpy1hAHgC7-jBkdrMm2Lg4umEgR8ZtiqwYnApPHryIQSeC8Rlscf49yniTyLOkommIexEX5wInKHD63ivYVaG2ywzZOLj6oqJ4cWBfyMK6yH1irfnsmVVjkpi7QZahPeFSNny6Yu9Q&__tn__=q&c[0]=AT14VwMm-lO7zaNwWBmAGt5jg3RMH6Ncjb4I7ZU1bbga8uohzvak3kRITuJznsYkJEYuEb_G20zaD0TLqAXrQdgEWJmBoHDpGPBQOoZ-3rZ_xmSCZfBDSIsEYmaS9pWt6w1UpMyV_m6pTHCKSMOJWAMXL1PFF8M_sFosdvmHU9lsGIfEk2vz)
