The performing artist, who handles the pencil, brush and words with the same ease and expressiveness, something recognized by art critics and lovers of beauty, Horaţiu Mălăele is one of the most important Romanian actors and directors. The actor, the director, the poet, and the graphic designer alike believe that art represents the deepest expression of human creativity, an indefinable mixture of curiosity, ineffable, love, which transcends the real, ascends to the abstract and approaches God. "Where there is beauty, there is God", said the ancient Greeks, because love and beauty belong to divinity!

Feminine – creation and fascination, an exhibition signed by Horaţiu Mălăele at the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery, between October 29 and November 10, brings together 18 works, dedicated to the eternal fascination of the female nude. Subject of artistic contemplation, since ancient times, the female body encloses countless symbols and mysteries in its semantics. From the ancient Greeks, who had a cult for physical beauty, until the Renaissance, when the nude is brought back to the center of the creative vision of the great painters and sculptors, the feminine beauty has not ceased to evoke, under the brush, pencil or chisel of the masters, the most expressive and emotional artistic representations.

Under the distinct artistic sign of a name already entrusted to art, in its various forms of manifestation, the same and yet always different, Horatiu Mălăele perceives the female nude in a personal representation, the result of an irrepressible need to communicate, to give to those around , beauty, creativity and symbol. Because when he's not acting, Horatiu thinks about a drawing page, and when he's finished a caricature he's preparing to enter a new role or he's imagining the lines of a new show. In the theater or in the movie! It is the prerogative of the great creators, of history and art!

He has over 40 personal exhibitions, both in the country and abroad, Paris, Munich, Buenos Aires, Toronto and New York, are just some of the most famous cities in the world that have hosted the drawings and caricatures of Horațiu Mălăele. His friends, actors, other plastic artists and more, are the main subject of Horațiu Mălăele's works. From one-line portraits to carefully constructed nudes, from watercolors to dense abstract painting, his works hide in their essence a semantics of symbols.

Refined and with an almost gentle simplicity, passionate or innocent in their eroticism, casual or shy, the works present in the exhibition capture the beauty of the female nude, beyond the erotic and intangible. Above all, however, remains the same eternal, inexhaustible and perpetually fascinating charm of feminine beauty.

And since the aspects that concern him are infinite, Horațiu Malaele includes them in an overview, translating them into the simplest, clearest, comprehensive, synthetic forms possible. In art, the form is never perfect by itself, but by what it manages to express!

About this great artist, Radu Beligan testified: "Everything Horatiu Mălăele does, when it is not simply exceptional, is downright brilliant!"

The exhibition is organized by the Rotenberg – Uzunov Gallery, one of the most important contemporary art galleries in Bucharest and the Cultural Association for the Support of Fine Arts and can be visited from Monday to Friday, between 2:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., Saturday and Sunday: 2:00 p.m. – 8:00 p.m. , in compliance with the safety rules in force, in order to prevent contamination with the new SARS-COV-2 coronavirus.
