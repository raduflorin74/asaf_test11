RAID by Raimund Vernica

RAID, exhibition for sale signed by the young artist Raimund Vernica (known under the artistic pseudonym RAID), awaits you from Thursday, March 18, 2021, at 5:00 p.m., at the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery, with more than 20 works, most of them unexhibited public until now, some being made especially for this event.

The world of RAID's art is a very special world of the mind. A luxuriant creativity, doubled by a native talent, a thoroughness and precision of details taken to the extreme, in perfect contrast with a world unable to understand the complexity of his emotions and his own experiences.

"The stories about me, about my city, about the encounters and the people I interact with are born from a line. I'm not interested in the relationship between form and color. I'm interested in expressing basic human emotions: tragedy, joy, ecstasy, despair and so on," says the artist.

With an extraordinary talent for drawing, which he does, often from cerebral instinct, Raid's works must be viewed, deciphered and decrypted in the depth of the meanings of his soul. Line by line, geometric, abstract, the surrealism of his work cries out for a normality that is difficult to achieve and build in everyday life.\
They are enigmatic, unsettling, obsessive, lonely, but so deeply human.\
Signed encrypted, RAID, the works in the exhibition convey a depth of the artist's thinking, which tries to shatter the canons of the life in which he lives, the depersonalization and metamorphosis of the self.

More than 20 works that "talk" about an entire human category, await you starting March 18, 2021, at 5:00 p.m., at the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery, one of the most important galleries in Bucharest, in support of contemporary art and artists.

And RAID is one of the well-rated contemporary artists at the auction houses, supported by the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery and the art man Eduard Uzunov.

The exhibition is organized by the **Gallery Rotenberg – Uzunov** and the **Cultural Association for the Support of Fine Arts** and can be visited from Monday to Friday, between 14:30 - 19:30, and Sunday: 14:00 - 20:00, in compliance with the safety rules in force, in order to prevent contamination with the new SARS-COV-2 coronavirus.
