Wednesday, September 28, 2022, 5:00 p.m., the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery, in partnership with the Cultural Association for the Support of Fine Arts, awaits you in the contemporary art space, with the most special exhibition of the fall.

"The mirror is a door through which you can step into a mysterious world. In another time and another space", says Manuela Holban (Ioanid). Four years after the last exhibition in Romania, Manuela Holban (Ioanid) returns home again, with an exhibition.

In a permanent relationship with one's own inner springs of transformation, the art of Manuela Holban (Ioanid) inspires refinement and sensitivity, strength and fragility, alike.

Sculptures of deep personal emotions and experiences, the 30 works in the exhibition are a symbol of the search for inner strength, healing, love and truth. Rooted simultaneously between the past and the present, the characters in his paintings navigate the labyrinth of time and space, like pieces in a chess game, without knowing that someone else dominates them and guides their destiny.\
Sequences from a never-ending story!

Essence paintings, in which the imagistic archetypes and symbolism of the characters go to the essence and synthesis, Manuela Holban (Ioanid) recreates in simplicity her own style, a world without time, a world in which the deep self aspires to human knowledge, uniting the features of the spirit and the soul in a universe that never began and never ended.

The magic of the characters, the real and the imaginary of the plastic approach, attract the attention of the lover of beauty through their expressiveness, through the original perspectives of the plastic vision of the world, but also through the intelligent attempt to question the self.

Treated through the prism of artistic concepts related to the spiritual sphere, the human figures in the works of Manuela Holban (Ioanid) talk about the expression of the inner world. In formal terms, the female face often appears in a decorative, stylized form, surrounded by diffused light and muted colors, in a range of cold colors, which amplifies the emotional expressiveness of the work.\
The entire chromatic construction of the painting corresponds to the character's state of detachment from the real world and retreat into the depths of his spiritual universe.

"Art does not reproduce the visible, it makes things visible," said Paul Klee.\
The exhibition can be visited between September 28, 2022 and October 15, 2022, from Monday to Friday, between 2:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.
