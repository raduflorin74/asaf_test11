Autumn begins at the **Rotenberg - Uzunov Gallery**, one of the most important contemporary art galleries in Bucharest, with a unique exhibition: Feminism - under the signature of the artist **Răzvan Burnete**!

A graduate in 2018 of the National University of Arts in Bucharest, Painting department, university lecturer Dr. Ion Anghel, Răzvan Burnete prefers the technical approach of the artistic area, “considering that my works are an examination of human vanity. After all, our values ​​and experiences are just a mask that shines in the darkness of our minds. I am strict enough with the techniques I use, but I propose, through the layers of paint I lay, to give “life” to an inanimate look ”, the artist confessed about his creed.

His art is influenced by philosophy, as well as by the human condition, where humanity is the "thinking species." More than a work of art, his artistic production is a treatise on philosophy and psychology.\
The characters that populate his works cease to be real beings, they metamorphose into archetypes that correspond to universal themes: love, desire, anguish, loneliness, melancholy, death.

His artistic vocabulary of oil paints is fascinating: a whole palette of colors, sometimes dense and aggressive, sometimes fine and transparent, make the work speak for itself.\
"It takes me time to analyze a canvas, the creative process ending only when I reach the desired technical conclusion, combining the knowledge gained from the" great masters "with a modern, personal note. Hence my constant need to evolve and improve my gesturalism, as if my conscience were following my effort as a supreme court ”.

Although he graduated from UNARTE Bucharest for three years, his works have been exhibited in Greece, the United Kingdom and Italy. He had personal and group exhibitions in the country and abroad, and in 2019 he participated in the Florence Biennale.

With a clear influence of the artistic environment in which he works, marked by everyday life and social reality, his works convey a strong message, and many meanings, which can be discovered with the opening of the exhibition FEMINISM, Tuesday, September 21, 18, at Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery.

The exhibition can be visited from Monday to Friday, between 14:30 and 19:30, Sunday: 12:00 - 17:00, in compliance with the safety regulations in force, in order to prevent contamination with the new SARS-VOC-2 coronavirus .
