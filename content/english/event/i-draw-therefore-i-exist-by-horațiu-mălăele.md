"*I think that art means curiosity, ineffability, ambiguity, transcends the real, rises in the abstract, approaches God. This closeness could be one of the secrets that motivates our existence*! ''.\
**Horatiu Mălăele**

**Rotenberg Gallery - Uzunov** and the **Cultural Association for the Support of Fine Arts** invite you on Wednesday, November 17, at 17:00, to the opening of the exhibition Drawing, so I exist !, signed by Horaţiu Mălăele.

One of the most important Romanian actors and directors, recognized as a professional graphic artist by the Union of Fine Artists, Graphic Section, has over 50 personal exhibitions both in the country and abroad. Paris, Munich, Buenos Aires, Toronto and New York are just some of the most famous cities in the world that hosted Horaţiu Mălăele's drawings and caricatures.

Big names of Romanian culture, friends, actors, other artists and not only make the main subject of Horaţiu Mălăele's works. From single-line portraits to carefully constructed nudes, from watercolors to dense abstract painting, you will all meet on the sims of the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery!

An indefinable mixture of strength and suggestion, symbol, compositional refinement and mixture of color, the artistic form through which Mălăele chose to express himself, combines caricature, drawing, pastel, prose, poetry, self-portrait in words and touches of genius .... All in the unmistakable pencil of the artist!

Pampered of life, a genius with a soul in which fit, without confronting in different planes, the material and ideal forms of the world of yesterday and today, all merge in a mind in which they are arranged «every month and in the stars », so that both the actor, the director, the poet, and the graphic designer believe that art is the deepest expression of human creativity!

About 20 works, portraits of "Great People", self-portraits, nudes in drawing or watercolor, abstract works, emphasizing technical and artistic mastery, safety in plastic expression, both in line and in color, a dose of smile and a incredible passion, I define Horaţiu Mălăele's exhibition, I draw, so I exist!

"I had thought of making a portrait of Eminescu, but how to make Eminescu? I don't know when, I was asked by someone around whom would you ever want to stay? And I said… I wish I could be around Jesus, and at least a few hours around Eminescu… '' Horațiu Mălăele

The exhibition is organized by Rotenberg Gallery - Uzunov, one of the most important contemporary art galleries in Bucharest and the Cultural Association for the Support of Fine Arts and can be visited from Monday to Friday, between 14:30 -19: 30, Sunday: 12 : 00 - 17:00, in compliance with the safety regulations in force, in order to prevent contamination with the new coronavirus SARS-COV-2.
