As part of the *"Magic Summer*" International Festival, one of Europe's outstanding summer cultural events, with over 120 concerts, the quality of which was enjoyed by more than 80,000 spectators, **Rotenberg-Uzunov Art Gallery** and **ASAF** invite you on Tuesday, July 6 , 19:30, in the preview of the opening of the Festival, at the opening of the painting exhibition of the artist Oana Forgaci Pavelescu.


A graduate of UNARTE Bucharest, Professor Petru Lucaci's class, Oana Pavelescu approaches themes with deep symbols in her work. Opting, in general, for a brightly colored palette, which does not lack contrasts, her works are made in several segments, as strong as they are poetic.


In her work, the artist uses the most diverse materials - cardboard, iron, plastic, string, paper, colors, wood, plaster - creating, thus, a combination of materials with multiple functions, to which she lends artistic valences.
In the exhibition, you can see works that translate music into art and make the characters sing.


Violin - signifies memory, stirring lyricism and tenderness, Ladder - symbol of ascent, classical, denoting not only the ascent to knowledge, but also a significant landmark of the ascent, Harlequin (jester) - name from Italian comedy and given to a character always dressed in a coat made of pieces of triangular fabric, having different colors, a symbol of the doubling of the human being, are just some of the artistic symbols you will encounter in the exhibition at the Rotenberg-Uzunov Art Gallery.


Along with painting, installations in the form of musical instruments of monumental dimensions, which have the violin as their common symbol, made in the mixed-media technique, combining several materials for a special artistic effect, will be able to be seen both in the Rotenberg-Uzunov exhibition Art Gallery, as well as in the foyer of the Romanian Athenaeum, throughout the duration of the Festival, Rotenberg-Uzunov Art Gallery, being one of the partners of this event.
In compliance with the safety rules in force, in order to prevent contamination with the new SARS-COV-2 coronavirus.
