Thursday, April 14, 5 pm, a new exhibition project, at the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery!\
Digital art with performative actions and sound experiments, illustrating once again the interdisciplinarity, and, at the same time, the hybridization of the visual art, militating for the repositioning of the human being in relation to nature and technology!

The title of the exhibition The locked people project, signed by Ersin Bactişa, speaks about the fact that, today more than ever, seeing and being seen requires a technological mediation. Thus, the very metaphysical being presupposes a more and more insistent presence than the physical one. And, while our existential value is quantified in the number of likes, followers, hearts gathered by profile photography, our memory, remembrance, inner retrieval essentially preserve the decisive activity of man in the production of aesthetic values, technology being only means of expression.

The artist Ersin Bactisa proves to be an infinite fighter. The destiny of every human being tends to become his mirror and vital substance, putting him to the test as a survivor or confronting him with aesthetic choices. Versatile, like the Renaissance, pushed by chance on the thinnest trajectory of existence, Ersin takes revenge every waking second and (re) produces visual material, using the most diverse tools, from brush, to codes, from canvas or paper, in 3D and NFT modeling, draws the exuberant avant-garde of the new stylistic pleasures of humanity.

The portraits, which seem to be outlined with the brush but are the result of the skilful use of digital virtual and print media, are associated in a natural charade of discovery, unlocking individual intimacy and enunciation of faith, beyond any rational or pragmatic filter. Adaptation to the environment, part of the process of perpetuation of any species, is transfigured into code strings and sequences of symbols, represented by keys, wheels, keyholes or, in the case of the young artist, in alignments of two-dimensional images with three-dimensional effects.

The expression path of the multivalent young man focuses on perennial topographies, thoughts, emotions, sensitivity, rebirth, momentum are defining elements of a soul / spirit overflowing with empathy and human involvement. His artistic production, revealed in canvas panels, like surreal paintings, busts of seemingly enigmatic characters, but in itself, completely open to the world, reveals, in fact, the interiors, the intercellular spaces in which any creative impulse is consumed and coagulated. . As Ersin himself says, portraits do not look like us but feel like us - each of them is an intermediary between the author's hope and the viewer's reality.

Ersin's people are like an architect, through education and professionalism, determined by life to discover new and new environments of imagining visual expression, in an endless competition between moments of slipping, doubt and faith in humanity and its own fulfillment.
