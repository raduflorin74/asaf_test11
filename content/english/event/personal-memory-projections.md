The year 2022 begins at the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery, with an exhibition of strength, symbol and color, under the signature of an Armenian ethnic artist, Ovidiu Panighianţ.\
Born on December 15, 1961, in a family of intellectuals with Armenian roots, Ovidiu manifested his artistic sense as a young man, through various forms of expression, such as sculpture, painting and drawing.

He graduated from the “Nicolae Grigorescu” Academy of Arts in Bucharest, Faculty of Fine Arts-Graphic Department, in 1997, having as professors, two famous graphic designers: Dan Ion Erceanu and Mircia Dumitrescu. The talent, doubled by work, made him get a "Tempus" scholarship during his university studies in Bath, in Great Britain. From 1997 to 1999, he was an illustrator and graphic artist at the National Library of Romania. Since 2000, he has started a permanent collaboration, as Art Director & Design and graphic designer on CD covers, with Soft Records, but also with "Musical Report" magazine. He became Graphic Designer / Art Director at the magazines “Plai cu boi” and “Aspirina saracului” (led by the writer Mircea Dinescu), and since 2009 he is part of the team of authors of the most accessed humor website in Romania, www.timesnewroman. ro.

A series of solo shows and group exhibitions, since his student days, embody an innate talent in terms of color supremacy and image vitality. The exhibitions are a testament to this:\
“Academy Gallery Art” (“Lazarea ’93”), “Artexpo-Municpal Show”, “Galla Gallery” from 1996, at the “Eforie” Galleries in 1997, at the Gallery of the Union of Fine Artists from Târgu Mureş in 2000 and 2002, Orizont ”in Bucharest and“ Cupola Gallery ”in Iaşi, also in 2002 and also in 2002, at“ Gallery Apollo ”in Venice, then, in 2016, at the Cotroceni National Museum in Bucharest and at the Art Gallery of the Palace of Nations from Geneva.

Among the personal exhibitions are those from 2017, from the Art Museum in Cluj-Napoca, the Gallery of the Union of Visual Artists in Alba Iulia and "Atelier Art C 14" in Bistrita. Significant private collections from abroad, from France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Norway, Canada and the USA gathers the name of Ovidiu Panighianţ in the suite of contemporary artists.

His graphic designs have left their mark on various satirical posters, book illustrations, magazines, posters, leaflets, painting and tourism catalogs, audio tapes, commercials, comics, animation, as well as on the CDs of several albums produced by Soft Records.

The exhibition "Projections of personal memory", which will open on Thursday, February 3, 2022, at 17:00, at the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery, brings together a series of representations, of "frames", which are nothing but the projections of a strong imaginary, marked of melancholy. ”\
Looking closely at the works, it can be seen that, in his works, Ovidiu leaves no room ... for space. It is almost non-existent, being filled to the brim with characters.

His characters swallow the whole compositional plane: the horizon, the sky and the earth. And themselves. His characters become scenography. An imaginary universe, in which the central element is represented by the figurativism of the human body.\
"Prometheus", "Danae", "Tribute to Chagall", "Hug" are some of the works you will encounter on the simes of the exhibition, in a continuous metamorphosis of artistic forms, ideas and languages, which seduce with a bewildering sincerity. .

The works are passed through a parodic filter, behind which hides a shy, fragile, authentic nature, which manages to artistically free itself from shyness, through a self-irony often led to sarcasm. A surprising mix, which incites and provokes!
