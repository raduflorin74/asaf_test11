THE NATIONAL AESTHETICS SYMPOSIUM

"Stained glass windows of national cultural-artistic excellence"

30 YEARS SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE "GEORGE APOSTU" CULTURAL CENTER

The generosity with which George Apostu offered part of his work to the public space, but also to his friends, is already proverbial. Widely known for its sculptural dimension, George Apostu's work would be incomplete without his achievements in the field of drawing and ceramics.

This is why, in a daring attempt to recover his work, spread throughout the world, the "George Apostu" Culture Center will organize, on November 12, 2020, at 5:00 p.m., the drawing, ceramic and sculpture exhibition "Meditation" , a title with strong introspective valences.

Having a completely new character, the exhibition brings together works in private collections belonging to Adrian Năstase, Valentin Macovescu, Eduard Mircea Uzunov (present in the exhibition with the generous help of the Cultural Association for the Support of Fine Arts - ASAF), Radu Călin Georgescu, as well as works from the heritage of the "George Apostu" Cultural Center.

The exhibition will be presented to the public by the art critic, beautician, prof. univ.dr. Petru Bejan, from the University "Al. I. Cuza" from Iasi.
