It is a project of the soul, through which we try to bring a ray of light into the lives of these children, and their parents, in search of reducing the severity of autistic symptoms to the possible stop of their evolution. Because, they say, art heals and soothes, art is perfection, it's a dream, it's an emotion, it's a story, it's a panacea for the mind and soul, and when it's directed to the relief of children in pain, it can become a ray of hope ", said Eduard Uzunov, the owner of the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery.

The Mifne Romania project brings the Mifne method to Romania, establishing the first center for early diagnosis and intensive early treatment for babies identified at risk of developing autism and their families. The project is carried out by the Turning Point in Early Autism Association, a non-profit organization established at the beginning of 2021, in the city of Piatra Neamţ, with the mission of improving the quality of life of families with children with autism.

We are waiting for you, to share this experience together, for a cause of the soul!

Good bye!
