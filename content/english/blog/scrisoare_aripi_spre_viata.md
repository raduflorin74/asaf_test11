**Wings For Life  Association, for
CULTURAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE SUPPORT OF FINE ARTS**

Behind every successful project there are several people who, through what they do and the way they move things, mobilize you to want and do a lot of good.

In these lines, I want to thank some wonderful people, who through involvement and a lot of love for children, led us into a panacea story for the souls, the "ART GIVES HOPE" project.

Our partnership meant many hours of work, discussions and ideas put on paper, a collaboration beyond the usual ones and a "different" project that enriched the pediatric department of the Fundeni Clinic Institute and the Pediatric Day Hospitalization Center with 40 donated paintings by 23 artists through the Rotenberg-Uzunov Art Gallery.

CULTURAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE SUPPORT OF FINE ARTS together with the Rotenberg-Uzunov Art Gallery were our initiators and hosts for the "ART GIVES HOPE" project, they supported the project and constantly communicated with the artists who wanted to donate these works for joy and healing children affected by cancer and other serious diseases. Many colors, beloved characters, clowns and harlequins, light and splendor, in these paintings that we are sure will be part of some stories with a happy ending. 

We were especially pleased to partner with you and thank you very much
much for a project that beyond words will remain testimony in time, a project that would never have been possible without your unconditional support.
We were delighted to work together, miraculously goodness,
compassion and generosity have not stopped manifesting themselves in everything that the "ART GIVES HOPE" project has meant, and that is why we welcomed with joy the proposal to continue together.



Thank you,
President Wings For Life
