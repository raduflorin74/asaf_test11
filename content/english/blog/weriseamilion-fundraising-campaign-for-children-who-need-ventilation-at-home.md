**The Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery, the Cultural Association for the Support of Fine Arts (ASAF) and the Aripi Spre Viață Association are launching the #strangemunmillion campaign, for the benefit of children who need ventilation at home.**

The initiative aims to raise the necessary sums for the purchase of ventilation devices, to pay the rents of the already existing ones, and their specific consumables, for the year 2022.

The campaign launch event takes place on December 8, starting at 5:00 p.m., at the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery, located in Constantin Esarcu street no. 1, where, in a fairy tale setting, whose scenography bears the signature of Adrian Damian, an exhibition will be opened with the sale of 30,000 Christmas cards.

The congratulations are made by one of the best photographers and authors of art albums in Romania, Gheorghe Voicu; some of them are made with gold leaf and printed 30 years ago, being given to the #strangemunmillion initiative by the late illustrator's wife.

From 2018 until now, the Wins for Life Association has provided financial support worth almost 450,000 lei for Valentina, Ioana, Ana-Maria, Iulia, Sofia, Ilinca-Alexandra, Ionela and Alexandru, eight children in the records of the pediatric department respiratory department of the Emergency Clinical Hospital M.S. Curie, and diagnosed with serious ailments. 

The dependence of these children on breathing machines would condemn them to permanent hospitalization, that is why the organizers of the #weriseamilion campaign aim to give them a real chance at life, at home, in a family environment.

The congratulations can be purchased at the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery headquarters, between 8.12. and 23.12.2021, as well as online on the website www.rotenberguzunov.ro.
