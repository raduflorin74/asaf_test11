The "Art gives hope" project was initiated by the businessman Eduard Uzunov, the Rotenberg-Uzunov Gallery, the "Association for the Support of Fine Arts" (ASAF) and the "Wings for Life" Association. It consists in donating paintings to the hospital with the highest addressability in Romania, where even 5,000 children are admitted annually, according to a press release. 

***The paintings will be made in the own workshops of the artists who will donate one or more works, depending on their personal vision, on the theme that gave the title of the project: "Art gives hope".***

Afterwards, the completed works will be evaluated by ASAF specialists and donated to the Fundeni Clinical Institute, becoming part of the institution's heritage.

However, before arriving in the salons and reserves of the 6th floor of the Fundeni Clinical Institute and in the newly established Hospitalization Center in the courtyard of the medical unit, the works will be brought together in a vernissage, which will take place, at the beginning of December, at the Rotenberg Gallery - Uzunov.

Among the artists from the country and abroad who embraced this idea are: Marilena Murariu, Costin Neamțu, Lisandru Neamțu, Stela Vesa, Carmen Marin, Lucia Pușcașu, Lucian Liciu, Ion Drăghici, Gabriela Drăghici, Vasile Dobre, Arina Bican, Ileana Dragomirescu , Vali Irina Ciobanu, Carmen Poenaru, Emanoela Szabo, Ion Văcăreanu, Mugurel Bărbulescu, Sanda Butiu, Oana Barsan, Damir Petru, Alexandra Johansen, Martina Grigorita and Corina Perianu.

"*It is a project of the soul through which we try to bring a ray of light into the lives of these suffering children, their parents, who are constantly by their side in the hospital and, last but not least, the medical staff who take care of them. Because, they say, art heals and soothes, art is perfection, it's a dream, it's a story, it's a panacea for the mind and soul, and when it's directed at people in great suffering, it can become a ray of hope*", he declared Eduard Uzunov, the initiator of the project. 

The association "Wings for life" has already renovated the 6th floor of the Fundeni Clinical Institute, through the project "Big hearts for the smiles of the little ones", supported by hundreds of people, and is currently building the first day hospitalization center, for the benefit of children affected by cancer , who undergo long-term treatments and who belong to a high-risk group, being immunosuppressed both because of the disease and the cytostatic treatment.
