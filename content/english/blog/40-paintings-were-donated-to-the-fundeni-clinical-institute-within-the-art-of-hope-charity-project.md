The artworks made or donated by artists for the project initiated by businessman **Eduard Uzunov**, the "*Cultural Association for the Support of Fine Arts" (ASAF*) and the "Wings for Life" Association were handed over to the representatives of the medical unit, on a donation basis, after they were exposed to the public for one day at the *Rotenberg-Uzunov Art Gallery.*

The artists from the country and abroad, who embraced this idea wholeheartedly were: Marilena Murariu, Costin Neamțu, Lisandru Neamțu, Stela Vesa, Carmen Marin, Lucia Pușcașu, Lucian Liciu, Ion Drăghici, Gabriela Drăghici, Eugen Macinic, Vasile Dobre, Arina Bican, Ileana Dragomirescu, Vali Irina Ciobanu, Carmen Poenaru, Emanuela Szabo, Irina Florescu, Ion Văcăreanu, Mugurel Bărbulescu, Sanda Butiu, Oana Bîrsan, Damir Petru and Alexandra Johansen, and most of them were present at the organized exhibition in the center of the Capital.

*"It's a project of the soul, through which we try to bring a ray of light into the lives of these suffering children, their parents, who are constantly by their side in the hospital and, last but not least, the medical staff who take care of them. Because, they say, art heals and soothes, art is perfection, it's a dream, it's a story, it's a panacea for the mind and soul, and when it's directed at people in great suffering, it can become a ray of hope*", he declared Eduard Uzunov, the initiator of the project.

The association "**Wings for Life**" has already renovated the 6th floor of the Fundeni Clinical Institute through the project "Big hearts for the smiles of the little ones", supported by hundreds of people, and recently opened the first day hospitalization center, for the benefit of children affected by cancer, who undergo long-term treatments and who belong to a high-risk group, being immunosuppressed both because of the disease and the cytostatic treatment.

"Supporting these children has become part of our lives in the 10 years since we have been volunteering for pediatric hospitals. A soul connection was created between us and the medical staff and we tried every time it was needed, to be present and do everything we could to save a life or ease the suffering and worries of some families, so that the parents could focus as much as possible on caring for their children", explained **Nicoleta Stoenescu**, president of the "Wings for Life" Association.

For her part, the president of *ASAF- Cultural Association for the Support of Fine Arts* , **Adina Rențea**, opened her soul for this project: "We started this endeavor, being convinced that "art gives wings, not crutches", as the great Victor Hugo said, and we will succeed by gathering works of art donated by renowned artists, to bring relief, comfort and hope, for mind, body and soul".
